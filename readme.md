# üß† Building an End-to-End LLM Project with RAG and AI Agents

Welcome! In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through how to build an **end-to-end LLM project** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), web search with **Tavily**, and intelligent **AI agents** using **CrewAI**.

**What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. They utilize deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to perform tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. These models are foundational in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation tools.  

**Why Do LLMs Hallucinate?**

Hallucinations in LLMs occur when the model generates information that is factually incorrect or entirely fabricated. This happens because LLMs predict text based on patterns in their training data without understanding the content. When faced with unfamiliar queries or insufficient context, they may produce plausible-sounding but inaccurate responses.  

**What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by integrating real-time information retrieval. When a query is made, RAG systems fetch relevant data from external sources, such as databases or the internet, and use this information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach reduces hallucinations and ensures that the AI provides up-to-date information.

**What Are AI Agents?**

AI agents are software systems designed to autonomously perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can interact with users, other systems, or their environment, and are often powered by machine learning to adapt and improve over time. Unlike traditional software that follows predefined instructions, AI agents can learn from data and experiences to make informed decisions.

## üìò Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to combine various tools and techniques to create a powerful **domain-specific question-answering system** enhanced with real-time search and collaborative AI agents similar to [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai).

---

## üîß Key Components of the Project

### 1. Environment Setup

The project begins by installing key libraries and loading environment variables:

- [`langchain`](https://python.langchain.com) ‚Äì Framework for LLM apps
- [`tavily-python`](https://pypi.org/project/tavily-python/) ‚Äì Real-time search API
- `groq` ‚Äì For inferencing LLM models running on groq cloud, so you don't have to run the LLM models on your local system

**Note:** Ensure you get your API keys (groq, Tavily) and add them in the jupyter notebook file.

---

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Documents are loaded from the `crew_data` folder.
- They‚Äôre chunked using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for efficient indexing.
- Each chunk is converted into an **embedding vector** using OpenAI Embeddings.
- The embeddings are indexed with **FAISS**, a high-performance similarity search library.

> üß† Why RAG?  
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation lets LLMs provide more accurate answers by pulling relevant info from a custom knowledge base.

---

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented QA

The FAISS vectorstore is used to retrieve documents relevant to a user‚Äôs query. The query and context are passed to the LLM to generate a meaningful response.

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
```

---

### 4. üåê Tavily Search Integration

**Tavily** lets you add real-time web search capability to your AI agents.

#### Setup

```bash
pip install tavily-python
```

```python
from tavily import TavilyClient

tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key=TAVILY_API_KEY)
```

#### Example

```python
tavily_client.search(query="latest advancements in LLMs")
```

> üîç **Why Tavily?**  
> Great for retrieving up-to-date web data ‚Äî ideal for dynamic and current-event-based use cases.

### 5. ü§ñ CrewAI Agent Creation

In this project, we used CrewAI to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively. Each agent is defined with a clear role, a specific goal, and a custom toolset. Here's a breakdown of the agents implemented in the notebook:

#### 1. Researcher Agent
**Role**: Researcher

**Goal**: Conduct deep research on a given query by retrieving information from both the local vectorstore and live web sources.

**Tools**: FAISS retriever (for custom document knowledge base) and Tavily search (for real-time web data)

#### 2. Writer Agent
**Role**: Content Writer

**Goal**: Generate detailed and structured responses or reports based on the information retrieved by the Researcher Agent.

**Tools**: LLM for generation, with context provided by the Researcher.

#### 3. Critic Agent
**Role**: Reviewer

**Goal**: Evaluate the response generated by the Writer Agent, check for factual accuracy, coherence, and completeness, and suggest improvements.

**Tools**: LLM for analysis and refinement tasks.

---
These agents collaborate under CrewAI‚Äôs coordination framework, where each agent autonomously performs its task and hands off results to the next agent in the workflow. This mirrors a human-like team environment, enabling a more robust and scalable AI solution.

> üí° **Why CrewAI?**  
> CrewAI simplifies the process of designing, managing, and scaling multi-agent AI systems. It brings structure and collaboration to autonomous AI workflows, making it perfect for tasks requiring research, synthesis, and review.

Using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai), the project sets up multiple agents:

- Each agent has a **role**, **goal**, and **toolset** (e.g., retriever, Tavily).
- Agents can **collaborate** to achieve a shared objective (e.g., generate a report or perform research).

> This is how you simulate **team-based AI problem solving**.

## üß™ Student Tasks

To deepen your understanding, try these hands-on activities:

### Task 1: Explore the Vectorstore
- Use `.similarity_search()` to see what documents match a query.
- Visualize embeddings using PCA or t-SNE.

### Task 2: Expand the Knowledge Base
- Add new documents to `crew_data`.
- Rebuild the FAISS index and test retrieval with new queries.

### Task 3: Create a New AI Agent
- Define a new role (e.g., ‚ÄúTrend Analyst‚Äù).
- Give it the **Tavily tool** and a goal like ‚ÄúSummarize the latest news on AI‚Äù.

### Task 4: Report Generator Agent
- Design an agent to collect insights and export them as a structured report (Markdown, PDF, etc.).

### Bonus Task: Compare Retrieval Methods
- Explore local LLM inferencing frameworks such as Ollama, Huggingface transformers etc instead of groq
- Replace FAISS with other vectorstores (e.g., Chroma).
- Test different chunk sizes, overlaps, and embedding models.
- Create an API using flask/django or frontend using streamlit.
- Dockerise the flask API/streamlit app for deployment.

## üßµ Summary

This project gives you practical experience in:

- **Custom document QA** with RAG
- **Real-time search** using Tavily
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with CrewAI

By expanding this notebook, you'll be well on your way to building your own AI-powered assistants.
